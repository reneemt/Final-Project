        Hey there! 
        I'm Renée, an artist from San Jose, CA who loves playing with color, texture, and vibe. My digital art primarily focuses on people and poses. I try various tricks with color and rendering but my confidence is in my lineworks and poses.

      <h2>My Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a big fan of various artists like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/naomykwc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@naomyKWC</a>, whose style and animations have inspired the content I'm shifting to create, and I am inspired by the character design of artists like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/azi_makes_art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@azi_makes_art</a>. I want to get better at making characters and stories through practice in my free time.

      <h2>How I Added Works</h2>
      <p>The categories in my gallery reflect contexts that I have created for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Michigan in Color</strong>: The section in the Michigan Daily that I would draw for.</li>
        <li><strong>Studies</strong>: Includes learning pieces, exercises, and growth snapshots.</li>
        <li><strong>Free for All</strong>: Where I let loose and create with no rules and reason.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This site is part of my final project and my way of saying “look what I’ve made!” I hope you enjoy scrolling through and clicking around. Every piece has a little story behind it—even the messy ones.
